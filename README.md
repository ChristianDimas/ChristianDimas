    This project is a side project of mine where I made a manga-style cutscene system that uses manga pages as a way to present a cinematic experience. Aside from that, I also made a dialogue system that also fits the manga aesthetic.  </p>

    Catch The Odds is a falling object catcher type of game where you must catch the odd-sided polygons 
    falling from above, where the game gradually gets faster and faster, while maintaining control of the player. 
    I did this project solo, so I'm responsible for the game design, art, and the programming side, but I got my 
    SFXs from outside sources.

    Hike is a 2D pixelated platformer game where you must go your way to the top of the level to win the game. Along your journey, there will be many obstacles of many kinds. I did this project solo, so I'm responsible for the game design, most of the art (took the background somewhere on the internet), and the programming side, but I got my SFXs from outside sources.
