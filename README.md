    Catch The Odds is a falling object catcher type of game where you must catch the odd-sided polygons 
    falling from above, where the game gradually gets faster and faster, while maintaining control of the player. 
    I did this project solo, so I'm responsible for the game design, art, and the programming side, but I got my 
    SFXs from outside sources.

  <p>
    Blappy Fird is a Flappy-Bird-like type of game where the player survives as long as possible by avoiding the pipes. What's different in my version of the game is that the pipes move up and down over time, increasing the difficulty and focus needed by the player. I did this project solo, so I'm responsible for the game design, art, and the programming side, but I got my SFXs from outside sources.

    This project is a side project of mine where I made a manga-style cutscene system that uses manga pages as a way to present a cinematic experience. Aside from that, I also made a dialogue system that also fits the manga aesthetic.  </p>
